Gene Expression Analysis

Overview:
This project aims to analyze gene expression data to understand the behavior of various genes across different samples. By applying statistical methods and visualizations, the project identifies patterns in gene expression that may help uncover insights into biological processes, health conditions, and potential treatment targets for diseases.

Project Components:
The analysis involves several key steps:

Gene Expression Data: 
Raw gene expression data is collected, representing how active certain genes are in various samples (e.g., from healthy and diseased tissues).

Statistical Analysis: We analyze the expression levels of genes to identify relationships, variations, and key patterns.

Visualization: Various plots, including heatmaps, box plots, and bar plots, are used to visually summarize the gene expression data and highlight important findings.

Data:
The dataset used in this project consists of gene expression levels across multiple samples. Each gene is represented by a row, and each sample is represented by a column. The expression levels indicate how much a gene is "expressing" in each sample.

Columns in the Data:
Gene: The name or identifier of the gene.
Sample ID: The identifier for each sample (e.g., tissue type or experimental condition).
Gene Expression Level: The measurement of gene activity for each sample.

Key Features:
Gene Expression Summary: Statistical summaries of gene expression data, including average expression levels and variability.
Correlation Heatmap: A heatmap visualizing the relationships between gene expression levels, highlighting genes that express similarly across samples.
Box Plot: A box plot showing the distribution and spread of gene expression values, helping to identify outliers and variations.
Bar Plot: A bar plot displaying the average expression levels of genes across all samples.
